# Fall Stability Analysis

This project analyzes postural stability data collected from older adults and students using multiple devices (Force Plate, ZED 2i, Smartphones).

## Project Structure

- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the raw data
- **Device Comparison**: Statistical agreement between devices (Pearson, Blandâ€“Altman, ICC, CCC, Deming Regression)
- **Group Analysis**: Significance tests between participant groups
- **Fatigue & Learning**: Analysis across repeated trials
- **Classification**: Binary models for stability classification
- **Clustering**: Unsupervised analysis of stability profiles

## Notebooks

See `/notebooks` for step-by-step exploratory analysis and final results.
